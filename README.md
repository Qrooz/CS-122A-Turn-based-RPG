# CS-122A-Turn-based-RPG
A simple turn based RPG game similar to games such as Pok√©mon is implemented utilizing a ST7735 display, and a joystick for user control. The game consists of displaying the back of the player character as well as the enemy character in front. The player has several attacking moves which are slime bubble, poison, and chomp which each have individual attacking animatons and sounds. The attacks also do differing amount of damage. The enemy character has only one attacking move which causes the screen to flash different colors when the player takes damage. Additionally the health bars of the player and the enemy are in full view at all times. When the player beats the enemy, the winning screen is displayed, and oppositely if the platyer loses then the losing screen is dispalyed.
